# CrE Roadmap FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the CrE Roadmap?
The CrE Roadmap, also known as "The Crazy Error Roadmap", "The Official Crazy Error Roadmap", and 「クレージー・エラー・ロードマップ / クレーマップ」, is as its name suggests, indeed a roadmap. A unqiue type of roadmap.
The CrE Roadmap tracks all advancements in crazy errors, from new features to brand new crazy errors coming out, to small creators just getting started, to really cool BGMs that are underrated.
We track it all. Including changes in trends of how crazy errors are created, crazy error collabs, and more information.

## What is the purpose of the CrE Roadmap?
The CrE Roadmap actually was designed with multiple purposes in mind. This CrE is designed for crazy error viewers, crazy error makers, and crazy error history buffs alike.
The Cre Roadmap was designed with care, for many purposes, but especially the following:
* **Preserving History** The CrE Roadmap helps preserve the history of crazy errors and their advancements. In addition, we also regularly may upload crazy errors and BGMs to the Internet Archive to preserve them.
* **Tracking Advancements** Its hard to track changes and origins, we know. Which is why we're doing it for you. We track advancements and new trends in crazy errors and can even give insights into the future.
* **Crazy Error Listing** We can help to provide listings of crazy errors created, and also organize them by timelines, as well as find uploads across many sites like YouTube, Niko Niko Douga, Vimeo, Bilibili and more.
* **BGM Listing** We can help track the state of BGMs, new BGMs, and even trends in how BGMs and their corresponding videos (if any) are created.
